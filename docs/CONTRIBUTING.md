# CONTRIBUTING: HOW-TO

In order to contribut to Spacetime Energy Dynamics (SED), you can follow the usual collaborative workflow of GitHub. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to contribute to the project:

## Step 1: Fork the repository

The first step is to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository in your account that you can work on.

To fork the repository, click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

## Step 2: Clone the repository

Once you have forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

## Step 3: Create a new branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch to work on. This will help keep your changes separate from the main branch.

You can create a new branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch.

## Step 4: Make your changes

Now you can make your changes to the project. You can add new files, modify existing files, or delete files as needed.

## Step 5: Commit your changes

Once you have made your changes, you can commit them to your branch using the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Replace `"Your commit message here"` with a brief description of the changes you have made.

## Step 6: Push your changes

After committing your changes, you can push them to your forked repository using the following command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created in step 3.

## Step 7: Create a pull request

Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

To create a pull request, go to the main repository page and click on the "New pull request" button. Select your branch as the compare branch and click on "Create pull request".

## Step 8: Review and merge

After you have created a pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback. Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they will be merged into the main repository.

That's it! You have successfully contributed to the Spacetime Energy Dynamics (SED) project. Thank you for your contribution!

If you have any questions or need help with the contribution process, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or open an issue on the repository. We are happy to help!
